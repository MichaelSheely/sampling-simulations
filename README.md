# Sampling Simulations

## Background

A repository to hold various probabilistic simulations to investigate
probaballistic investigations.  These programs will, in general, be
simple python files that investiage different questions and output their
own data on an ad hoc basis.

## The gBike Problem

Around the Googleplex, one may notice that there are a large number of bikes
avalible for quick transit between buildings.  Many of these bikes also feature
helpful hints for how to ride the bikes, along the lines of the following:

Things brings up the following question? How long would it take until we see all
of the helpful bike riding hints?  To make things simple, we assume that
we use a bike once each day, that there is a uniform distribution of hints
across gBikes and that each time we use a bike, we select it at random from
the set of gBikes.

We may note that this question is isomorphic to asking the following question:
  - If uniformly sampling `n` objects with replacement, what is the expected value of the number of trials before all `n` objects will be sampled?

We may approach this question from both an analytic and computational approach.
